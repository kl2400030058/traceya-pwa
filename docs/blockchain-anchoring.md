# Blockchain Anchoring in Traceya App

## Overview

Blockchain anchoring is a planned feature for the Traceya App that will provide immutable verification of collection events. This document outlines the proposed implementation approach and benefits.

## Purpose

- **Data Integrity**: Ensure collection events cannot be tampered with
- **Traceability**: Create an immutable record of the supply chain
- **Verification**: Allow third parties to verify the authenticity of herbs
- **Transparency**: Build trust with consumers and regulatory bodies

## Proposed Implementation

### 1. Hash Generation

Each collection event will generate a cryptographic hash that includes:

```typescript
function generateEventHash(event: CollectionEvent): string {
  const dataToHash = {
    farmerId: event.farmerId,
    species: event.species,
    location: event.location,
    timestamp: event.timestamp,
    photoHashes: event.photoHashes,
    moisturePercentage: event.moisturePercentage,
    notes: event.notes
  };
  
  return sha256(JSON.stringify(dataToHash));
}
```

### 2. Merkle Tree Batching

To optimize blockchain transactions, multiple collection events will be batched using a Merkle tree:

```typescript
class MerkleTree {
  leaves: string[];
  root: string;
  
  constructor(events: CollectionEvent[]) {
    this.leaves = events.map(event => generateEventHash(event));
    this.root = this.buildTree(this.leaves);
  }
  
  buildTree(leaves: string[]): string {
    if (leaves.length === 1) return leaves[0];
    
    const parents: string[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < leaves.length; i += 2) {
      const left = leaves[i];
      const right = i + 1 < leaves.length ? leaves[i + 1] : left;
      const parent = sha256(left + right);
      parents.push(parent);
    }
    
    return this.buildTree(parents);
  }
  
  generateProof(eventHash: string): string[] {
    // Generate Merkle proof for a specific event
    // Implementation details omitted for brevity
  }
}
```

### 3. Blockchain Integration

#### Option A: Ethereum-based Anchoring

```solidity
// Smart contract (simplified)
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TraceyaAnchor {
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public merkleRoots;
    
    event RootAnchored(bytes32 root, uint256 timestamp);
    
    function anchorRoot(bytes32 merkleRoot) public {
        merkleRoots[merkleRoot] = block.timestamp;
        emit RootAnchored(merkleRoot, block.timestamp);
    }
    
    function verifyRoot(bytes32 merkleRoot) public view returns (uint256) {
        return merkleRoots[merkleRoot];
    }
}
```

#### Option B: Bitcoin Anchoring via OP_RETURN

```typescript
async function anchorToBlockchain(merkleRoot: string) {
  // Create a Bitcoin transaction with OP_RETURN containing the Merkle root
  // Implementation details would depend on the Bitcoin library used
}
```

### 4. Verification System

```typescript
async function verifyCollectionEvent(event: CollectionEvent, proof: string[], merkleRoot: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // 1. Verify the event hash is part of the Merkle tree using the proof
  const eventHash = generateEventHash(event);
  const validInTree = verifyMerkleProof(eventHash, proof, merkleRoot);
  
  // 2. Verify the Merkle root exists on the blockchain
  const contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, ABI, provider);
  const timestampOnChain = await contract.verifyRoot(merkleRoot);
  
  return validInTree && timestampOnChain > 0;
}
```

## User Interface

### Anchoring Status Indicators

- **Pending**: Collection event saved locally but not yet anchored
- **Processing**: Merkle tree being built and submitted to blockchain
- **Anchored**: Successfully recorded on blockchain with timestamp
- **Verified**: Third-party verification completed

### Verification Interface

- QR code scanning for consumers
- Batch verification for regulatory bodies
- Visual supply chain journey with blockchain verification points

## Technical Considerations

### Gas Costs and Optimization

- Batch multiple events in a single Merkle tree
- Use layer 2 solutions or sidechains for cost reduction
- Consider gas price fluctuations in transaction scheduling

### Privacy Considerations

- Only hash data is stored on-chain, not raw collection data
- Sensitive farmer information remains off-chain
- Selective disclosure mechanisms for verification

### Blockchain Selection Criteria

| Blockchain | Pros | Cons |
|------------|------|------|
| Ethereum | Smart contract support, widespread adoption | Higher gas costs |
| Bitcoin | Highest security, simple anchoring | Limited programmability |
| Polygon | Low fees, Ethereum compatibility | Less decentralized |
| Hyperledger | Private chain options, enterprise-ready | Less public verifiability |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept

- Implement hash generation for collection events
- Create Merkle tree implementation
- Develop testnet anchoring on Ethereum or Polygon

### Phase 2: Production Implementation

- Move to production blockchain
- Implement batch processing for efficiency
- Develop verification API and interface

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Multi-chain anchoring for redundancy
- Automated verification reporting
- Integration with industry certification systems

## Benefits for Stakeholders

### Farmers

- Proof of authentic collection practices
- Potential premium pricing for verified herbs
- Immutable record of their contributions

### Processors

- Verified sourcing information
- Quality assurance through traceability
- Regulatory compliance documentation

### Consumers

- Verification of authentic Ayurvedic herbs
- Transparency into sourcing and processing
- Trust in product quality and authenticity

## Conclusion

Blockchain anchoring will add a critical layer of trust and verification to the Traceya App ecosystem. By creating an immutable record of collection events, we can ensure the integrity of the Ayurvedic herb supply chain from farm to consumer.
